# Virtual Pet

This is a simple tamagotchi like game.  

You have a weird pet.  You can do things with the weird pet. The weird pet may not always show it, but it reacts in different ways to the things you do with it.  

Be careful to be attentive to your pet - if you don't take care of its needs, bad things may happen.




Notes on the code/goals for future iterations:

I'd like to find a way to have the game tick endlessly regardless of whether the user inputs an action or not.  I tried to do some research and experimentation on how to do this but ultimately wound up running out of time.  

I'd like to have the output be static -- only one face on screen at a time, and it changes rather than outputting a new face to the console.  The options are always below this, and the result of whatever you just did is always below that.  No new lines are added ever, but the current lines change based on input.  

I really hope that I'm not the only one who let the pet die or run away...

I also hope that I'm not the only GLaDOS fan...

The pet is random weird cat emoji from the internet.
